# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX for "No entrypoint found" Error

## The Problem
Vercel is looking for entry files in the **root directory**, but your Next.js app is in the `frontend` folder.

## ⚡ FASTEST FIX (30 seconds)

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to**: [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) → Your Project
2. **Click**: Settings (top right) → General
3. **Find**: "Root Directory" 
4. **Click**: Edit button
5. **Enter**: `frontend`
6. **Click**: Save
7. **Go to**: Deployments tab
8. **Click**: Redeploy (three dots menu)

**That's it!** The build should work now.

### Option 2: Use vercel.json (Already Created)

I've created a `vercel.json` file in your root directory. 

**Just commit and push it:**
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add vercel.json for frontend build"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy and use this configuration.

## Why This Happens

Vercel needs to know **where your Next.js app is**. By default, it looks in the root directory, but your app is in `frontend/`.

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Set Root Directory to `frontend` (in Vercel settings)
- ✅ Use `vercel.json` to tell Vercel where to build from

## After Fixing

Your build logs should show:
```
✓ Installing dependencies
✓ Building Next.js app  
✓ Build completed successfully
```

Instead of:
```
✗ Error: No entrypoint found
```

## Still Not Working?

1. **Check Root Directory is set**: Settings → General → Root Directory = `frontend`
2. **Check Framework**: Should be "Next.js" (auto-detected)
3. **Clear build cache**: Settings → General → Clear Build Cache
4. **Redeploy**: Deployments → Redeploy

---

**Most likely fix: Set Root Directory to `frontend` in Vercel settings!**
