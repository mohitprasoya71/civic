4. Click **Edit**
5. Enter: `frontend`

## ✅ That's It!

Your app should now work. The 404 error was because Vercel was looking in the wrong directory.

## Still Getting 404?

### Check Build Logs:
1. Click on the deployment
2. Check **Build Logs** tab
3. Look for errors

### Common Issues:

**"Cannot find module"**
→ Dependencies missing. Make sure `frontend/package.json` has all packages.

**"Build failed"**
→ Check the error message in build logs.

**"Output directory not found"**
→ Don't set Output Directory manually. Leave it empty.

## Correct Settings Summary

```
✅ Root Directory: frontend
✅ Framework Preset: Next.js
✅ Build Command: (empty - auto)
✅ Output Directory: (empty - auto)
✅ Install Command: (empty - auto)
```
